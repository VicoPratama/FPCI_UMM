Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI) was formed with the aim of developing Indonesian internationalism, making it more entrenched throughout the archipelago, and projecting itself to the rest of the world. FPCI is determined to form a large international relations community with mature and sensitive insights on bilateral, regional and global issues. FPCI aims to be a facilitator that can bring the “world” to the region and simultaneously bring grassroots and regional thoughts to the national and world stage.
